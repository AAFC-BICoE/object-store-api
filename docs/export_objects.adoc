= Object Export

The object-store-api can export objects in a compressed (zip) file.

== Request an export

Send a POST request to `object-export` with a body like:
```
{
  "data": {
    "type": "object-export",
    "attributes": {
      "name": "my export",
      "fileIdentifiers": ["fileUUID"]
    }
  }
}
```

The response will include the export UUID.

To include files in folder(s), add the following attributes:

```
"exportLayout": { "subfolder/" : ["fileUUID"] }
```

To use an alternative name (alias) for files:
```
"filenameAliases": { "fileUUID" : "myFileAlias" }
```

To apply a function to the object before the export (jpeg image only):
```
{
"exportFunctions":{"functionDef":"IMG_RESIZE","params":["0.5"]}
}
```

== Export processing

* Assemble the export and compress the content in an archive
* Emit a message on the messaging system including a <<_temporary_object_access, toa>>
* export-api downloads the archive
* The archive is deleted and available in the export-api
