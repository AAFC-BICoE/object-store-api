= Filtering API response data

== RSQL

objectstore-api supports https://github.com/jirutka/rsql-parser[RSQL (REST query language)] for
more complex filter queries.

Example:

```
localhost:8080/api/managed-attribute?filter[rsql]=( name=='attr1' or name=='attr2' )
```

This would return all managed-attributes with the name "attr1" or "attr2".
