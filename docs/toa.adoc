= Temporary Object Access

The object-store can generate temporary files that can be downloaded by another service using a randomly generated key.
The key is communicated using an event (message).


== Sequence of operations

* Create a temporary file (e.g. image export)
* Register the file to get a key
* Trigger an event on the message queue to indicate a file is available
* The consumer pulls the file using the key (`/toa/{key}` endpoint)
* The key is removed from usable keys
* The temporary file is deleted from the object-store temporary storage
