# Authenticating with GitHub Maven Package Registry

In order to install the Dina-Base-API dependencies, you will need to create a personal access token with GitHub.

Without this setup you will not be able to properly run a `mvn install`.

## Step 1: Create a personal access token with GitHub

You must create a personal access token with the appropriate package level scope at link:https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line[Creating a personal access token for the command line]

Ensure your access token has the following scopes

 read:packages

## Step 2: Using the personal access token

The next step is to create a ~/.m2/settings.xml if one does not exists.

Inside of ~/.m2/settings.xml you will need the following snippet.

....
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<settings>
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>github</id>
      <username>GITHUB_USER_NAME</username>
      <password>GITHUB_TOKEN</password>
    </server>
  </servers>
</settings>j
....

Where you would replace GITHUB_USER_NAME and GITHUB_TOKEN with your username and token.

After this you will be able to properly build the project.
