= Lazy Logging

We can avoid the calculation of log messages for log levels that are not enabled through the use of lazy logging.

To do so we use Lambda Expressions inside the logging statements.


.Normal statement
[source,java]
----
logger.trace("Number is {}", getRandomNumber());
----

.Lazy Logging statement
[source,java]
----
logger.trace("Number is {}", () -> getRandomNumber());
----

.Lazy Logging statement with multiple lambdas
[source,java]
----
logger.trace("Name is {} and age is {}", () -> getName(), () -> getRandomNumber());
----


The lambda expression is only evaluated if the corresponding log level is enabled
