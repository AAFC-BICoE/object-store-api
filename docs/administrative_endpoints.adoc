== Regenerate Thumbnails

Send a POST request to `derivative-generation` with a body like:
```
{
  "data": {
    "type": "derivative-generation",
    "attributes": {
      "metadataUuid": "uuid of the original object",
      "derivativeType": "THUMBNAIL_IMAGE",
      "derivedFromType": "LARGE_IMAGE"
    }
  }
}
```

That will instruct the api to generate a thumbnail from the large image derivative. This should be used in cases where the
original object can not be used to create the thumbnails (like raw image files). Otherwise, `derivedFromType` should simply be omitted to
use the original object as a source.
